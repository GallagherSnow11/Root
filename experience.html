                        <p>I've worked with people for a long time. 
                            I started working in custumer service when I was 16, in the retail industry. 
                            I've stayed in that industry my entire career with short pauses to pursue other priorities. 
                            I've moved up from basic customer service to managment within a grocery store setting where I am not only responsible for the customers and their experience, 
                            but also my team and the well being of the store at large.</p>
                        <p>I took a two year break from customer service when I served a two year mission to Stockholm, Sweden. 
                            I learned the swedish language, lived on my own, and taught people about Jesus Christ, 
                            all while living away from friends and family. 
                            It took sacrifice, but I learned more about myself and what it truly means to love others. </p>
                        <p>After returning from my mission, I not only jumped back into the retail industry, but I went full-time into school. 
                            As I began college, I became involved with the student counil with my program. 
                            I was quickly voted President of the Council, and I was responsible for many of the logistics and advertising for our many activities. 
                            It taught me more about what it means to be a leader and a friend at the same time. 
                            Becasue people need to be led by those they can rely on and trust. 
                            Someone who is going to have their back and help them through problems, not just throw more problems on them.</p>
